To run the demo code:

You may first download the dataset from Google Drive:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AYHy-wUV0IwPoA7E1zvMRPL3wK0tPNiY?usp=drive_link

and put the folder under data folder.

## Step 1
Run scripts/decomposition.sh for data decomposition and labeling. 
## Step 2
Run scripts/low_level.sh for low-level policy optimization. 

Update: We now provide trained model checkpoints for sub-agents, which can be directly used to train meta-policy.
## Step 3
Run scripts/high_level.sh for meta-policy optimization.
